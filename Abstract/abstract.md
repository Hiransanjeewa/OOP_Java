Abstract classes doesn't allow creating instances . 
Sometimes when we have parent class and subclasses , creting instances from the parent class doesn't have a meaning. 
EX - Animal class -> cat, dog , elephant
but there are still methods and variables in the parent class. 
Once we have a abstract method in the parent class every child has to override the method . 

abstract classes determines how subclasses should organized


 Instance class
 Every value of the interface class by default in static and the final form we need to add value when defining
 Every method in the interface class by default, they are abstract methods.
